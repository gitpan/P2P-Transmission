P2P-Transmission version 0.01
=============================

Checks a list of urls for specific return codes and then returns a 
code / header / page of it's own.  This is useful for web server 
clusters where you might have a switch or a web server performing 
periodic health checks on an application.  This module allows you 
to harness the checks of all the urls (web services) a specific 
node might have in one easy to "check" URL.
