P2P-Transmission version 0.06
=============================

P2P::Transmission can be used to control the popular cross-platform
Transmission BitTorrent client. The module supports both the common
GUI-based client as well as the lesser-known transmission-daemon.

Control of the client is achieved using an RPC interface provided by 
the client itself. The module implements the documented 1.41 RPC spec.
